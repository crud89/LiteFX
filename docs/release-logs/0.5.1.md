# LiteFX 0.5.1 - Alpha 05

- Improved descriptor management.
  - Common descriptor allocation and binding architecture. (See [PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))
  - Unbounded arrays are no longer implicitly defined by setting the array element size to maximum. This allows to define multiple descriptor sets containing unbounded descriptor arrays without exceeding device limits in Vulkan. (See [PR #166](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/166))
  - Binding hints can now be passed to shader reflection to have better control over the pipeline layout without falling back to explicit definitions. (See [PR #168](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/168))
  - Descriptor sets can now mix samplers and other resources in a single set. (See [PR #170](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/170))
  - Descriptor types can now be specified at bind time, rather than pipeline creation time. (See [PR #172](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/172)) 
  - Descriptors on global descriptor heaps are now allocated from virtual allocators. (See [PR #188](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/188))
  - Command buffers can now track temporary descriptor sets to keep them allocated until the command buffer finished. (See [PR #188](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/188))
- Improved memory management.
  - Add support for putting resources on GPU upload heaps using ReBAR. (See [PR #175](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/175))
  - Implement queries for memory statistics. (See [PR #184](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/184))
  - Implement `AllocationBehavior` flags, that can be used to control what happens, if memory budgets are depleted. (See [PR #186](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/186))
  - Add factory methods that don't throw if an allocation fails, but return a boolean instead to inform about success or failure. (See [PR #186](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/186))
- Texel buffer formats can now be specified during resource binding. (See [PR #173](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/173))
- Additional shader stages for a descriptor set layout can now be provided through piepline binding hints. (See [PR #185](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/185))
- Implement support for vertex buffer input rates. (See [PR #187](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/187))
- Expose virtual allocators in the rendering API. (See [PR #188](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/188))
- Implement support for depth bounds testing. (See [PR #189](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/189))

**🌋 Vulkan:**

- Implement descriptor management using `VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer`. (See [PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))
- Fixed issue that caused the native Vulkan swap chain to not properly transition present targets, if the DirectX 12 backend was enabled. (See [PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))
- Fixed destruction of descriptor set layout handles. ([PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))

**❎ DirectX 12:**

- Fixed an issue where scissor rects that did not start at the window origin were incorrectly passed to the pipeline. (See [PR #158](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/158))
- Fixed an issue that caused image and sampler arrays to be mapped incorrectly to the underlying descriptor sets. (See [PR #159](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/159))
- Added support for manually allocating descriptor ranges from global descriptor heaps. (See [PR #174](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/174))

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**

- Fix issue where re-configuring the project would fail due to `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` or `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` cache variables are being reset. (see [PR #157](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/157))
- Fix deprecation warning for some literal operators. (See [PR #161](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/161))
- Fix debug layer warning about invalid stencil target access when a depth-only render target was used. (See [PR #170](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/170))
