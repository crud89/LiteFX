# LiteFX 0.5.1 - Alpha 05

- Improved descriptor management.
  - Common descriptor allocation and binding architecture. (See [PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))
  - Unbounded arrays are no longer implicitly defined by setting the array element size to maximum. This allows to define multiple descriptor sets containing unbounded descriptor arrays without exceeding device limits in Vulkan. (See [PR #166](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/166))
  - Binding hints can now be passed to shader reflection to have better control over the pipeline layout without falling back to explicit definitions. (See [PR #168](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/168))

**🌋 Vulkan:**

- Implement descriptor management using `VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer`. (See [PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))
- Fixed issue that caused the native Vulkan swap chain to not properly transition present targets, if the DirectX 12 backend was enabled. (See [PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))
- Fixed destruction of descriptor set layout handles. ([PR #165](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/165))

**❎ DirectX 12:**

- Fixed an issue where scissor rects that did not start at the window origin were incorrectly passed to the pipeline. (See [PR #158](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/158))
- Fixed an issue that caused image and sampler arrays to be mapped incorrectly to the underlying descriptor sets. (See [PR #159](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/159))

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**

- Fix issue where re-configuring the project would fail due to `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` or `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` cache variables are being reset. (see [PR #157](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/157))
- Fix deprecation warning for some literal operators. (See [PR #161](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/161))
