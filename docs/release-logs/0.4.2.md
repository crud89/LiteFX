# LiteFX 0.4.2 - Alpha 04 Patch 01

**🌋 Vulkan:**

- Fixed an issue that caused wrong image layout transitions for present targets, when using the Vulkan native swap chain when the D3D12 backend is enabled. (See [PR #169](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/169))
- Set static upper limit for the number of resources that can be bound to an unbounded array to 500.000 to prevent exceeding device limits when using multiple such descriptor arrays in a single pipeline. (See [PR #169](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/169))

**❎ DirectX 12:**

- Fixed an issue where scissor rects that did not start at the window origin were incorrectly passed to the pipeline. (See [PR #158](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/158))
- Fixed an issue that caused image and sampler arrays to be mapped incorrectly to the underlying descriptor sets. (See [PR #159](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/159))

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**

- Fix issue where re-configuring the project would fail due to `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` or `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` cache variables are being reset. (see [PR #157](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/157))
