# LiteFX 0.4.1 - Alpha 04

- Adapt C++23 where applicable ([See PR #98](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/98) and [PR #102](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/102)). This includes:
  - Many of the range adaptors could be simplified.
  - The adaptor `ranges::to` has been replaced with the STL counterpart.
  - A novel `Enumerable` container is introduced to pass around immutable collections.
  - Some places that previously used `std::ranges::generate` or `std::generate` now use `std::generator`.
  - Builders are now `constexpr` where possible and are implemented using `deducing this` in place of CRTP, which makes them more lightweight.
- New event infrastructure. ([See PR #81](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/81))
- Add support for user-defined debug markers. ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
- Improved resource allocation and binding: ([See PR #83](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/83))
  - Resources can now be created without querying the descriptor set layout or descriptor layout in advance.
  - When allocating descriptor sets, default bindings can be provided to make bind-once scenarios more straightforward.
- Improved handling of temporary command buffers. ([See PR #89](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/89))
  - Command buffers can now be submitted with shared ownership to a command queue, which then stores them and releases the references, if the submit fence is passed (during `waitFor`).
  - Command buffer transfers can now receive resources with shared ownership. Resource references are released in a similar fashion.
  - To share ownership, the `asShared` function can be used.
- Make most of the render pipeline state dynamic (viewports, scissors, ...). ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86))
- Vector conversion to math types can now be done for constant vectors. ([See PR #87](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/87))
- Backend types now import contra-variant interface functions instead of hiding them. ([See PR #91](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/91))
- Add support for GPU time measurements (*Timing Events*). ([See PR #94](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/94))
- Add builder interface for barriers and extent barrier flexibility. ([See PR #97](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/97))
- Add support for static secondary command buffers aka. bundles. ([See PR #100](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/100))

**🌋 Vulkan:**

- Raise minimum Vulkan SDK version to 1.3.204.1. ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86) and [See PR #88](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/88))
- `VK_EXT_debug_utils` is now enabled by default for the Vulkan backend in debug builds. ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
- Images are now implicitly transitioned during transfer operations. ([See PR #93](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/93))

**❎ DirectX 12:**

- Use official PIX event runtime for DX12 x64 debug builds. ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
- Switch D3D12 runtime to DirectX Agility SDK. ([See PR #95](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/95))
- Add support for enhanced barriers. ([See PR #97](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/97))

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**

- Image dimensions are always clamped to a minimum of 1, so that resources with zero-dimensions can no longer be created. ([See PR #90](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/90))
