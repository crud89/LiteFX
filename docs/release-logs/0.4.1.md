# LiteFX 0.4.1 - Alpha 04

- Adapt C++23 where applicable. ([See PR #98](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/98), [PR #102](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/102) and [PR #113](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/113)) This includes:
  - Many of the range adaptors could be simplified.
  - The adaptor `ranges::to` has been replaced with the STL counterpart.
  - A novel `Enumerable` container is introduced to pass around immutable collections.
  - Some places that previously used `std::ranges::generate` or `std::generate` now use `std::generator`.
  - Builders are now `constexpr` where possible and are implemented using `deducing this` in place of CRTP, which makes them more lightweight.
  - New exceptions with support for `stacktrace` and `source_location`.
  - Replace `fmt` with `std::format`. ([See PR #128](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/128))
- Add support for compilation using clang. ([See PR #138](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/138))
- Allow static linking to the engine libraries. ([See PR #135](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/135))
- The namespace `rtti` has been renamed to `meta`. ([See PR #121](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/121))
- Improvements to C++ core guideline conformance. ([See PR #103](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/103))
- New event infrastructure. ([See PR #81](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/81))
- Add support for user-defined debug markers. ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
- Improved resource allocation and binding: ([See PR #83](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/83), [PR #110](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/110), [PR #111](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/111), [PR #123](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/123) and [PR #126](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/126))
  - Resources can now be created without querying the descriptor set layout or descriptor layout in advance.
  - When allocating descriptor sets, default bindings can be provided to make bind-once scenarios more straightforward.
  - Descriptor sets can also be allocated without providing any binding index (in which case continuous counting is assumed) or resources (which enables late binding or resource updating).
  - Descriptor set binding has been simplified by caching last used pipeline on command buffers and providing the possibility to bind multiple descriptor sets at once.
  - Binding to descriptors that are not part of the layout does no longer throw an exception.
- Improved handling of temporary command buffers. ([See PR #89](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/89) and [PR # 123](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/123))
  - Command buffers can now be submitted with shared ownership to a command queue, which then stores them and releases the references, if the submit fence is passed (during `waitFor`).
  - Command buffer transfers can now receive resources with shared ownership. Resource references are released in a similar fashion.
  - It is no longer required to manually allocate staging buffers, as raw data can now be passed to transfers on command buffers directly.
  - To share ownership, the `asShared` function can be used.
- Allow manual command queue allocation for advanced parallel workloads. ([See PR #112](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/112) and [PR #114](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/114))
  -  New "Compute" example demonstrates how to use and synchronize different graphics and compute queues.
- Make most of the render pipeline state dynamic (viewports, scissors, ...). ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86))
- Vector conversion to math types can now be done for constant vectors. ([See PR #87](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/87))
- Backend types now import contra-variant interface functions instead of hiding them. ([See PR #91](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/91))
- Add support for GPU time measurements (*Timing Events*). ([See PR #94](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/94))
- Add builder interface for barriers and extent barrier flexibility. ([See PR #97](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/97) and [PR #123](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/123))
- Add support for static secondary command buffers aka. bundles. ([See PR #100](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/100))
- Render targets are now created with a set of flags instead of individual boolean switches. ([See PR #114](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/114))
  - This also enables for more use cases, like using render targets in read-write bindings or sharing between different queues.
- Swap chains can now accept `present` calls without explicitly providing a frame buffer. ([See PR #114](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/114) and [PR #125](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/125))
- Build macros are now prefixed with `LITEFX_` to support portability. ([See PR #117](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/117))
- Add optional support for mesh shaders (enable `GraphicsDeviceFeatures::MeshShaders` to turn it on). ([See PR #116](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/116))
- Add optional support for ray-tracing and ray queries (enable `GraphicsDeviceFeatures::RayTracing` and/or `GraphicsDeviceFeatures::RayQueries` to turn it on). ([See PR #122](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/122))
- Render passes have been improved and simplified, now supporting automatic input attachment binding and event-based resize handlers. ([See PR #124](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/124))
- Frame buffers have been decoupled from render passes, allowing to share images between passes and binding resources of different sampling rates and resolutions to the same pass. ([See PR #125](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/125))
- Support for vertical synchronization has been added. ([See PR #127](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/127))
- Fetch DXC from vcpkg. ([See PR #131](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/131))
- Simplified math type interface. ([See PR #120](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/120))
- Add support for indirect draws/dispatches. ([See PR #118](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/118))
- Add native visualizers for improved debugging. ([See PR #137](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/137))

**üåã Vulkan:**

- Raise minimum Vulkan SDK version to 1.3.204.1. ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86) and [PR #88](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/88))
- `VK_EXT_debug_utils` is now enabled by default for the Vulkan backend in debug builds. ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
- Images are now implicitly transitioned during transfer operations. ([See PR #93](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/93))
- Command buffers no longer share a command pool, improving multi-threading behavior. ([See PR #112](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/112))
  - Queue allocation has also been reworked so that a queue from the most specialized queue family for a provided `QueueType` is returned.
- Empty descriptor sets are now allowed and may be automatically created to fill gaps in descriptor set space indices. ([See PR#110](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/110))
- Swap chain presentation uses fences instead of convoluted binary semaphores for synchronization. ([See PR #114](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/114))
  - Furthermore, the D3D interop version of the swap chain has been reworked to support proper frames in flight (as opposed to do a full CPU-wait before presenting).
- Descriptor set pool sizes are now determined dynamically, depending on the number of allocations. ([See PR #115](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/115))
- Use *Synchronization2* primitives for synchronization. ([See PR #122](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/122))
- Render passes have been replaced with dynamic rendering. ([See PR #125](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/125))

**‚ùé DirectX 12:**

- Link PIX event runtime for DX12 x64 builds by default. ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82) and ([PR #133](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/133))
- Switch D3D12 runtime to DirectX Agility SDK. ([See PR #95](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/95))

**üêû Bug Fixes:**

- Image dimensions are always clamped to a minimum of 1, so that resources with zero-dimensions can no longer be created. ([See PR #90](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/90))
- Missing formatters for DXIL and SPIR-V reflection types have been added. ([See PR #104](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/104))
- Input assembler states can now be defined without providing an index buffer layout. ([See PR #109](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/109))
- Image transitions now work correct if applied to individual layers only. ([See PR #122](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/122))
